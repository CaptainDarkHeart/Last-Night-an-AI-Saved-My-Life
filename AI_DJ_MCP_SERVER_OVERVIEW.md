# AI DJ MCP Server - Complete Overview

## 🎧 What We Built

A **fully functional MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that gives Claude AI-powered DJ mixing capabilities. You can now ask Claude to analyze tracks, detect cue points, suggest transitions, and help plan your deep space house DJ sets.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install (5 minutes)

```bash
cd ai-dj-mcp-server
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configure Claude Desktop

Edit: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-dj": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["-m", "ai_dj_mcp.server"],
      "cwd": "/Users/dantaylor/Claude/Last Night an AI Saved My Life/ai-dj-mcp-server/src"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

### 4. Test It

Ask Claude: **"Analyze the track at /path/to/your/track.wav"**

---

## 🎯 What You Can Do

### Talk to Claude About Your Music

**Instead of manually analyzing tracks, just ask Claude:**

- *"Analyze this track and tell me the BPM"*
- *"Find optimal cue points for my 60-90 second blends"*
- *"Can these two tracks be mixed together?"*
- *"Suggest transition points between these tracks"*
- *"Extract features for machine learning analysis"*

### Real Use Cases

1. **Prepare tracks for Traktor** - Get AI-suggested cue points
2. **Plan DJ sets** - Check BPM compatibility across your tracklist
3. **Build journey arcs** - Use Claude to analyze energy progression
4. **Train custom models** - Extract features from your 11,000+ track library

## 🛠 Available Tools

| Tool | What It Does | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **analyze_track** | BPM, beats, downbeats | "Analyze track.wav" |
| **detect_cue_points** | AI cue point detection | "Detect cue points for track.wav" |
| **suggest_transitions** | Plan mixes between tracks | "Suggest transitions between track1.wav and track2.wav" |
| **extract_features** | ML feature extraction | "Extract features from track.wav" |
| **calculate_bpm_compatibility** | Check mix compatibility | "Are 120 BPM and 122 BPM compatible?" |

---

## 💡 Integration with Your Workflow

### For Traktor Users
```
1. Ask Claude to detect cue points
2. Copy suggested times to Traktor
3. Use your 6-color cue system
4. Plan extended 60-90 second blends
```

### For Mixxx Users
```
1. Analyze tracks with Claude
2. Export intro/outro markers
3. Build smart playlists
4. Use with AutoDJ or manual mixing
```

### For Journey Arc Planning
```
1. Analyze your track collection
2. Find BPM/key compatible sequences
3. Build energy progression charts
4. Create A Minor harmonic journeys
```

## 🎵 Example Conversation with Claude

**You:** "Analyze /Music/Stimming - Una Pena.wav and detect cue points"

**Claude:**
```
Track Analysis: Stimming - Una Pena

Duration: 376.45 seconds (6:16)
BPM: 122.3
Beats detected: 767

Detected 12 optimal cue points:
  Cue 1: 0:08.12 (confidence: 0.876)
  Cue 2: 0:32.45 (confidence: 0.823)
  [...]

Suggested Intro/Outro for 60s blends:
  Intro Start: 8.12s
  Intro End: 32.45s
  Outro Start: 344.12s
  Outro End: 376.45s
```

**You:** "Perfect! Now suggest a transition to Sasha Carassi - Blurred.wav with a 75 second blend"

**Claude:**
```
Transition Analysis

Track 1: Stimming - Una Pena (122.3 BPM)
Track 2: Sasha Carassi - Blurred (121.8 BPM)

BPM Compatibility: ✓ Yes (1:1 ratio)
Tempo adjustment: -0.5 BPM

Suggested 75s blend:
  Start fading out Track 1 at: 5:01 (301.45s)
  Start fading in Track 2 at: 0:00

Mixing Strategy:
  - Beatmatch at 1:1 ratio
  - Layer atmospheric elements during 75s blend
  - Gradually swap bass EQ
  - Perfect for your deep space house style
```
